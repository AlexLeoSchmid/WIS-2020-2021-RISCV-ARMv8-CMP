\newacronym[description={Communication protocol located on the transport layer of the \gls{OSI} that provides a simple transmission model for packets without the overhead introduced by mechanisms for providing reliability, ordering, or data integrity, like handshaking dialogues. In \gls{UDP} the error detection and error correction is outsourced to higher layers like the application itself. Thus it is assumed that errors either have no influence for successfully processing the use--cases, or the correction is implemented inside of the application's using protocols.
