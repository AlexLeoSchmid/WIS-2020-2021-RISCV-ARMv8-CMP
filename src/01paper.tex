\section{Concept and Methods}
\label{ref:concept}
In order to determine whether RISC-V will gain a significant market share in the following years, it is useful to compare the two \glspl{ISA}
across a set of criteria that are relevant to semiconductor companies when evaluating which \gls{ISA} to use with a new CPU design.

The first of these criteria is the \gls{ISA}'s business model. \glspl{ISA} are often protected by patents that prohibit anyone not licensed
by the patent owner from distributing \glspl{CPU} that implement that \gls{ISA}. \cite{Tang2011} Whether these patents exist and the licensing terms
are an important factor when deciding which \gls{ISA} to use.

The \gls{ISA}'s complexity refers to the amount of effort required to implement the \gls{ISA}. The more complex an \gls{ISA} is, the more developer
time is spent on implementing and verifying a \gls{CPU}'s compatibility to the \gls{ISA}, instead of optimizing the \gls{CPU} for performance and efficiency,
increasing a \gls{CPU}'s development cost.

A \gls{CPU}'s performance can be evaluated under multiple aspects, including the rate of instructions, the rate of floating point operations or
the speed at which the CPU executes a given program. Efficiency considerations, such as the code size of a given program when compiled to the \gls{CPU}'s
instruction set or the amount of power the \gls{CPU} consumes when executing a given program are closely related to performance and shall, for the
purposes of this paper, be grouped under performance.

A program's code size is greatly influenced by the \gls{ISA}, since the instruction set and the compiler used are the only two factors that influence
code size. As such, the code size is an important factor to consider when choosing which \gls{ISA} to implement for a new processor design, especially
for microcontrollers that are usually very constrained in the size of their program memory.
For the other performance aspects, it is debatable to which extent they are influenced by the \gls{CPU}'s instruction set as opposed
to the concrete implementation of the CPU. \cite{Blem2013} \cite{Akram2017}

\glspl{ISA} often allow for a number of instruction set extensions that may or may not be implemented by a given \gls{CPU}. These usually allow
faster and more efficient processing of programs for a given use case, such as \gls{SIMD} extensions that optimize signal processing and media applications,
\gls{AES} extensions that optimize cryptography or \gls{ISA}-extensions with shorter instructions for applications that are constrained in program memory.
Having a small base instruction set with many fine grained extensions improves the flexibility of the \gls{ISA}, allowing \glspl{CPU} to be optimized for specific
use cases, increasing performance and efficiency for those use cases. \gls{ISA} extensions do however pose a disadvantage when distributing precompiled software
to end users, as a piece of software that uses a certain \gls{ISA} extension can't be executed on \glspl{CPU} that don't implement that extension, potentially
increasing the number of different versions of that software that need to be distributed.

An \gls{ISA}'s ecosystem refers to the software that supports that \gls{ISA}, especially compilers that compile to that \gls{ISA}, operating systems and libraries.
When developing a new \gls{CPU} it is preferrable to use an \gls{ISA} with a large ecosystem, in order to maximize the amount of software
that can run of that \gls{CPU}. This is especially important in consumer desktop and mobile devices where a large variety of software is to be executed,
but less important in embedded applications, where the software running on a microcontroller is specifically developed for that application and microcontroller
only.

	\subsection{Business Models}
	Who develops the CPU cores, how can you get access to them? Who supports chip manufacturers in designing a chip with that CPU core?
	\subsection{Structure and Complexity}
	How many instructions are there? How complex does that make the implementation of a core?
	\subsection{Performance}
	What are the differences in code size? Can we accurately compare the execution speed of both ISAs?
	\subsection{Extensibility}
	What instruction set extensions are there for both ISAs? Who can develop new extensions?
	\subsection{Ecosystem}
	Which compilers support ARM and RISC-V? Which operating systems and libraries?


\section{Discussion}
\label{ref:discussion}
	\subsection{ARM}
	What are the advantages of ARM compared to RISC-V?
	\subsection{RISC-V}
	What are the advantages of RISC-V compared to ARM?
	\subsection{Future directions and challenges}
	How can we more accurately measure performance differences between ARM and RISC-V and how do ISA extensions affect performance?
