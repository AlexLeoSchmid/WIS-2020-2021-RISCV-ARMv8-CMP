\section{Concept and Methods}
\label{ref:concept}
In order to determine whether RISC-V will gain a significant market share in the following years, it is useful to compare the two \glspl{ISA}
across a set of criteria that are relevant to semiconductor companies when evaluating which \gls{ISA} to use with a new CPU design.

The first of these criteria is the \gls{ISA}'s business model. \glspl{ISA} are often protected by patents that prohibit anyone not licensed
<<<<<<< HEAD
by the patent owner from distributing \glspl{CPU} that implement that \gls{ISA}. \cite{Tang2011}

Whether these patents exist and the licensing terms

are an important factor when deciding which \gls{ISA} to use.

The \gls{ISA}'s complexity refers to the amount of effort required to implement the \gls{ISA}. The more complex an \gls{ISA} is, the more developer
time is spent on implementing and verifying a \gls{CPU}'s compatibility to the \gls{ISA}, instead of optimizing the \gls{CPU} for performance and efficiency,

A \gls{CPU}'s performance can be evaluated under multiple aspects, including the rate of instructions, the rate of floating point operations or
the speed at which the CPU executes a given program. Efficiency considerations, such as the code size of a given program when compiled to the \gls{CPU}'s
instruction set or the amount of power the \gls{CPU} consumes when executing a given program are closely related to performance and shall, for the
purposes of this paper, be grouped under performance.

A program's code size is greatly influenced by the \gls{ISA}, since the instruction set and the compiler used are the only two factors that influence
code size. As such, the code size is an important factor to consider when choosing which \gls{ISA} to implement for a new processor design, especially
for microcontrollers that are usually very constrained in the size of their program memory.
For the other performance aspects, it is debatable to which extent they are influenced by the \gls{CPU}'s instruction set as opposed
to the concrete implementation of the CPU. \cite{Blem2013} \cite{Akram2017}

\glspl{ISA} often allow for a number of instruction set extensions that may or may not be implemented by a given \gls{CPU}. These usually allow

faster and more efficient processing of programs for a given use case, such as \gls{SIMD} extensions that optimize signal processing and media applications \cite[page 52]{Arm2020},
\gls{AES} extensions that optimize cryptography \cite{Arm2015} or \gls{ISA}-extensions with shorter instructions for applications that are constrained in program memory. \cite{Arm2005}

Having a small base instruction set with many fine grained extensions improves the flexibility of the \gls{ISA}, allowing \glspl{CPU} to be optimized for specific
use cases, increasing performance and efficiency for those use cases. \gls{ISA} extensions do however pose a disadvantage when distributing precompiled software
to end users, as a piece of software that uses a certain \gls{ISA} extension can't be executed on \glspl{CPU} that don't implement that extension, potentially
increasing the number of different versions of that software that need to be distributed.

An \gls{ISA}'s ecosystem refers to the software that supports that \gls{ISA}, especially compilers that compile to that \gls{ISA}, operating systems and libraries.
When developing a new \gls{CPU} it is preferrable to use an \gls{ISA} with a large ecosystem, in order to maximize the amount of software
that can run of that \gls{CPU}. This is especially important in consumer desktop and mobile devices where a large variety of software is to be executed,
but less important in embedded applications, where the software running on a microcontroller is specifically developed for that application and microcontroller
only.

	\subsection{Business Models}
	Who develops the CPU cores, how can you get access to them? Who supports chip manufacturers in designing a chip with that CPU core?
	\subsection{Structure and Complexity}
	How many instructions are there? How complex does that make the implementation of a core?
	\subsection{Performance}
	The code size of a given program is the performance factor that is most influenced by a \gls{CPU}'s \gls{ISA},
	since it is independent of the \gls{CPU}'s microarchitecture and only influenced by the \gls{ISA} and compiler.
	Given that code size is most critical in embedded applications, the Embench benchmark suite is a good benchmark
	with which to compare code sizes. The Embench benchmark suite consists of a number of programs frequently used in embedded
	applications, such as CRC, signal filtering, AES or QR code reading. \cite{Patterson2019}
	When compiling the Embench suite for both RV32IMC as well as 32-bit ARM with the Thumb-2 extension with GCC version 7,
	the code for RISC-V is approximately 11\% larger than the code for ARM. \cite{Perotti2020}
	Part of this gap in code size can be explained by the relative immaturity of the RISC-V support of
	GCC. RISC-V has only been added as a target for GCC in 2017 and the code size of the Embench suite
	compiled for RISC-V is lower with subsequent versions of GCC, however still larger than ARM as of 2019. \cite{Patterson2019}

	In \cite{Perotti2020} an extension for RISC-V is introduced, called HCC, that contains a number of instructions
	aimed at reducing the code size of RISC-V. This extension brings the code size gap down to 2.2\% for the Embench suite
	and makes the RISC-V code smaller than ARM by 1.75\% in a proprietary IoT benchmark developed by Huawei. \cite{Perotti2020}
	
	TODO: In subsequent submissions, mention RV64 being significantly smaller than AArch64 as described in \cite[page 62]{Waterman2016},
	and possibilities of comparing execution speed and energy efficiency as described in \cite{Blem2013} and \cite{Akram2017}.

	\subsection{Extensibility}
	What instruction set extensions are there for both ISAs? Who can develop new extensions?
	\subsection{Ecosystem}
	Which compilers support ARM and RISC-V? Which operating systems and libraries?

	\subsection{Advantages of RISC-V}
